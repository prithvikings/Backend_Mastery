Introduction to npm
npm (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js. It allows developers to easily install and manage dependencies for their projects.

Working with node and npm
1.  Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in the terminal or command prompt
2.  Run `npm init` to create a new `package.json` file
3.  Run `npm install <package-name>` to install a package
4.  Run `npm install <package-name> --save` to install a package and save 

if we will use npm init -y it will not ask any question and will install node package manager with default information

but if we will use only npm init only it will ask question regarding package name description license and more other questions.
