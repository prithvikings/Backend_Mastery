In backend their are two server:
1. Application server (node)
2. database server (mongodb)

-Application server : It basically handle the routes and accept the request

-Database server : It basically handle the data and store the data in the database. 


What is collection?
------------------------
A collection is a group of documents in a MongoDB database. Each document in a collection has a unique 
_id field that uniquely identifies the document. Collections are similar to tables in relational databases,
but they are more flexible and can store a variety of data types.



What is schema? 
----------------
A schema is a blueprint or design for a database. It defines the structure of the data, including 
the fields, data types, and relationships between them. In MongoDB, a schema is not enforced at
the database level, but it can be enforced at the application level using validation rules.



Database -> Collection -> Document

CODE                    DATABASE
-----------------------------------------
mongoose.connect ->     Database Create
mongoose.model   ->     Collection Create
Create           ->     Document Create 





-------------------
1. Node.js (it is javascript runtime enviroment)  
2. Express.js (it is web application framework for Node.js,It is designed for building web applications and APIs)
3. MongoDB driver (to connect with database server)
4. Mongoose (to interact with database)
5. Passport.js (for authentication)
6. JWT (for authentication and authorization)
7. Multer (for file upload)
8. Bcrypt (for password hashing)
9. Helmet (for security)
10. Cors (for cross-origin resource sharing)
