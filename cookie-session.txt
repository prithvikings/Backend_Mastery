what is the use of express.json()?

express.json() is a built-in middleware function in Express.js that parses incoming JSON requests. It is primarily used to handle JSON payloads sent in HTTP request bodies, such as in POST, PUT, or PATCH requests.

Use Case
When a client sends JSON data in the request body, express.json() helps extract and parse it into a JavaScript object, making it accessible in req.body.

Why is it needed?
Express does not parse request bodies by default.
Without express.json(), req.body would be undefined when handling JSON data.
It ensures that JSON payloads are converted into JavaScript objects automatically.
Alternatives
express.urlencoded({ extended: true }) → For parsing URL-encoded form data.
body-parser.json() (before Express 4.16.0) → Now integrated into Express as express.json().
